# Functional Programming

## What is Functional Programming

Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions which no side-effects outside their scope.

> `input -> process -> output`

Functional programming is about:

1. Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change

2. Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

3. Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled
