# Scratch Pad

## Day5 August 6, Monday

While learning **Applied Visual Design** at [FCC](https://freecodecamp.org) I learnt that background color can be set using background like this `background: linear-gradient(gradient_direction, color 1, color 2, color 3, ...);` Using `linear-gradient` has always been a challenge.

I also learnt about using `hsl()` specifically when children elements have to inherit and tweak their parent color.
