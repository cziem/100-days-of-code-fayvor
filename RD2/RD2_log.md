### Day12 August 17, Saturday

**Today's Work**: Trying to figure out why `populate` will not work durationa mongoose operation

**Thoughts**: It must be something I am missing

**Link to work**: mongodb docs, [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47370229/mongoose-document-populate-is-not-working)

**The Fix**: When calling a mongoose populate method, be sure that the `path` and the `model` are same names before you can use:

```js
// calling populate with no options

await collection.find({}).populate('Author');

/*
 * Be sure that the path and model are named Author, else try what is below
 */

// calling populate with options

await collection.find({}).populate({
	path: 'author',
	model: 'User'
});

/*
 * Where you have the schema property name of your collection as "author", and the model you want to referrence as "User"
 */
```
