### Day1 August 1, Wednessday

**Today's Work**: Today seem to be quite a day. I made some additions to the portfolio project then I setup the Kiddies-CodeCamp

**Thoughts**: I really love teaching... tech, coding, and it's fun when you have to show the light to kids and help them learn coding

### Day2 August 2, Thursday

**Today's Work**: Trying to fix `node_module`'s inclusion to git tracked files. Had quite a trouble with that.

**Thoughts**: I don't have data, a collegue of mine said `data is life` now i totally agree.
