### Day5 August 5, Sunday

**Today's Work**: Continued work on my portfolio project and had a little lesson session with FCC

**Thoughts**: I encoutered a bug with FCC Visual aid class which demanded I put a `<hr>` tag in a portion of the code. I did all things possible but wouldn't pass the test. I wondered why, not untill I asked a question in the community room.

### Day6 August 6, Monday

**Today's Work**: Made some progress with [FCC](https://freecodecamp.org) **Applied Visual Design**

**Thoughts**: Today I saw a new interest with css animations. It's quite beautiful what could be achieved with `::after` and `::before` psuedo tags. Am thinking of redesigning my portfolio project. But that would come later
