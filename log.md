**Today's Work**: Continuing my course with udacity's Intro to DOM manipulations.

With concepts like:

- `addEventListener()` method
- `removeEventListener()` this takes exact `type`, `listener fn` and `phase`.
- Event Delegation. That allows for managing multiple events with one listener.

**Thoughts**: It feels cool knowing more about the `element node` and it's properties.

**Link to work**: [Udacity](https://udacity.com)

### Day24 September 1, Saturday

**Today's Work**: Still on udacity's course. Learnt a few new concepts.

Concepts like listening for

- `DOMContentsLoaded` allows you to put some scripts in the head section of the HTML file and it won't throw any error.

Today I also started looking briefly at CSS Grids and I saw some video materials from WesBos's [CSS Griddy](https://cssgriddy.io)

**Thoughts**: Now I know why I see some framework scripts being inserted in the head section of some sites that use them. I've been wondering what's so cool about this css grid moxilla always talks about, now I see why it's so sweet. You could totally layout a complete website with it. It though has close functionalities with the css Flexbox

So I think of laying out something really simple like this ![awesome layout](./assets/images/griddyLayout.png)

**Link to work**: [Udacity](https://udacity.com)
