### Day23 August 31, Friday

**Today's Work**: Continuing my course with udacity's Intro to DOM manipulations.

With concepts like:
- `addEventListener()` method
- `removeEventListener()` this takes exact `type`, `listener fn` and `phase`.
- Event Delegation. That allows for managing multiple events with one listener.

**Thoughts**: It feels cool knowing more about the `element node` and it's properties.
